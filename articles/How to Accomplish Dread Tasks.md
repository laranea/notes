**Some strategies for tricking yourself into doing things you don't want to do but need to do.**

## Summary

- Thinking about a task causes an **emotional sensation** as our brain predicts whether we'll be engaged (**joy**) or  monotony/failure (**pain**).
- Starting a task but not completing it raises the **future cost** since your brain predicts from past behavior, which leads to an emotionally draining vicious cycle.

We can apply **strategies to reverse engineer our thought patterns** to beat these predictions:

1. **Break it down** - How do you get started?  What's the **smallest step** to make progress toward your goal?  For your predictive model, *success matters more than size*.  Don't allow ominous tasks into your list — not understanding what you need to do leads to predicting failure.
1. **Re-label** - Change the task's description to something more appealing that represents the *smallest increment of work* which you can commit to doing *right now*, effectively unfolding the task into bite-sized chunks.
1. **Visualization** - Demystify a task by imagining and directing a movie in your mind about how you'll complete it.  This gives your brain *positive training data* making *doing* the task less daunting.
1. **Talk to others** - Accomplishes three goals: (1) forces you to clarify your own thinking — a [forcing function](https://lifehacker.com/power-through-your-work-with-a-forcing-function-1748200646) to *think*, (2) accountability, (3) they might have ideas.
1. **Find another way** - Can you re-frame the problem, like automate it with code instead of doing it manually?  It might take longer, but comes with increased enjoyment.

We can also use temporary **willpower boosters** as tools to put us in a great mood:

1. **Music** - An energetic playlist.
1. **Workout** - After a workout, your brain is predicting success, so try squeezing in a dread task in right afterward.
1. **Coffee** - Just enough to be in a great mood (~4 oz for him) but not jittery.
