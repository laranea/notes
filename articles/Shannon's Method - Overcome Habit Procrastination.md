- **Shannon's method** is to visualize the extreme outcome of not doing a habit over time, then remind yourself that one small action today is all you need to do to avoid that.
- Kind of analogous to (missing out on) compound interest, but for behavior.
- On the slippery slope of skipping a day: "I just tell myself, 'You're not getting into that.  It's only going to take two minutes.  Just do it now.'"
